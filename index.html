                    <p class="message">I have spent the last five years working as an editor in children's publishing, where I have worked on countless books. And I am now looking to transition from publishing into tech. I believe my experience of project management and poring over language set me up for success in tech.</p>
                    <p class="speaker">Halimah says:</p>
                    <p class="message">As someone who grew up in the hey day of MSN (later Windows Live Messenger) I wanted my first website to harken back to that time as it was key to my experience of the internet as a child. I used to rush home after school to login to MSN and chat to my school friends and play all sorts of games with them. These form some of my fondest memories of using the internet pre-social media when we didn't have 24/7 access to other humans and because of my nostalgia, I thought it would be a great first project.</p>

                    <p class="speaker">Halimah says:</p>
                    <p class="message">As I touch on above, I remember being on the internet from the age of 4, using the likes of MSN, playing games on Miniclip and other now defunct websites. As part of that, I have always been interested in how websites work and perhaps my earliest introduction to this was learning how to build websites using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webs_(web_hosting)" target="_blank">Freewebs</a> (RIP) to create a Lord of the Rings fansite at the age of 8. However, despite this longstanding interest, apart from dabbling in the HTML and CSS of Tumblr and Wordpress themes, my previous attempts to teach myself how to code lacked focus and so fell to the wayside. Through FAC, I have discovered a renewed interest and the prerequisites have helped me focus my learning to establish the foundations that I hope will lead to a long career in software development.</p>
                    <p class="speaker">Halimah says:</p>
                    <p class="message">Beyond my general fascination with how websites work, I have always enjoyed puzzles and logic (my favourite combination of course being logic puzzles - shout out <a href="">Murdle!</a>). And this, along with my experience as an editor and eye for detail feel like key skills and interests I can apply to the world of coding.</p>
                    <p class="speaker">Halimah says:</p>
                    <p class="message">Coming from a creative industry like publishing, where salary and job progression are opaque and there is no clear way to learn except sporadically, I am also interested in tech due to what appears to be clearly set out, transparent career progression and opportunities. There are countless tutorials to learn bits of code and I can't say the same for learning to be an editor, which inevitably only benefits the privileged. After five years of being an editor and barely progressing, I feel I have done my time and I would like to explore other career paths where I can feel motivated and rewarded for the effort I put in.</p>
                    <p class="speaker">Halimah says:</p>
                    <p class="message">Finally, as I've been working from FAC's requirements, I have found myself feeling really excited about the endless possibilities for what I can learn and apply to improve my website. Even in making this website, I've had countless ideas - some of which I probably won't be able to implement due to current lack of knowledge or time - and I can't wait to come back to this website in a year or so and see all the ways I can improve this further. I really enjoy learning and applying and coming back to this has been hugely motivational at a time where I have felt quite dejected in my current career path due to lack of opportunity.</p>
